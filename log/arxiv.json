        "summary": "The angular distribution of gravitational-wave power from persistent sources may exhibit anisotropies arising from the large-scale structure of the Universe. This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave emitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first observing run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer techniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband persistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic decomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent gravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints to date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity estimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times 10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted sources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397 -- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1 \\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$. For persistent broadband sources, we constrain the gravitational-wave flux $F_{α, \\hat{n}}^{95\\%, \\mathrm{UL}}(25\\, \\mathrm{Hz}) < (0.008 - 5.5) \\times 10^{-8}\\, \\mathrm{erg\\, cm^{-2}\\, s^{-1}\\, Hz^{-1}}$, depending on the sky direction $\\hat{n}$ and spectral index $α=0,\\,2/3,\\,3$. Finally, for extended sources, we place upper limits on the strain angular power spectrum $C_\\ell^{1/2} < (0.63 - 17) \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$."

        "author": "The CMS",
        "published": "2014-11-17",
        "summary": "A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions $B^0_s\\toμ^+μ^-$ and $B^0\\toμ^+μ^-$ in proton-proton collisions at the LHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysis produces the first observation of the $B^0_s\\toμ^+μ^-$ decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the $B^0\\toμ^+μ^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statistically compatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on several theories beyond the SM."

        "author": " The IceCube Collaboration",
        "published": "2026-01-12",
        "summary": "The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg)."
